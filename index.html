                <header><h2>introduction</h2></header>
                <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
                <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
                <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>
                <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.</p>

            <section id="numbers" class="main-section">
                <header><h2>numbers</h2></header>
                <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping.</p>
                <code>
                    >>> 2 + 2
                    4
                    >>> 50 - 5*6
                    20
                    >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
                    5.0
                    >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
                    1.6
                </code>
                <p>The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.

                    Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:</p>

            <section id="strings" class="main-section">
                <header><h2>strings</h2></header> 
                <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to escape quotes:</p>
                <code>
                    >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
                    'spam eggs'
                    >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
                    "doesn't"
                    >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
                    "doesn't"
                    >>> '"Yes," they said.'
                    '"Yes," they said.'
                    >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
                    '"Yes," they said.'
                    >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                    '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                </code>
                <p>In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print() function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:</p>

            <section id="lists" class="main-section">
                <header><h2>lists</h2></header>
                <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>
                <code>
                    >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                    >>> squares
                    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                </code>
                <p>Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:</p>
                <code>
                    >>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
                    1
                    >>> squares[-1]
                    25
                    >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
                    [9, 16, 25]

            <section id="if_statements" class="main-section">
                <header><h2>if statements</h2></header> 
                <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement.</p>
                <code>
                    >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
                    Please enter an integer: 42
                    >>> if x < 0:
                    ...     x = 0
                    ...     print('Negative changed to zero')
                    ... elif x == 0:
                    ...     print('Zero')
                    ... elif x == 1:
                    ...     print('Single')
                    ... else:
                    ...     print('More')
                    ...
                    More
                </code>
                <p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.</p>

                <p>The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):</p>

                <header><h2>stacks</h2></header>
                <p>The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use append(). To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index.</p>

                <p>List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.</p>

                <p>We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple.</p>
                <p>A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:</p>

Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.</p>
                <p>Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.</p>

                <p>Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().</p>
                <p>It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.</p>
                <p>The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key.</p>
                <p>Performing list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use sorted(d) instead). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the in keyword.</p>
                <code>
                    >>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
                    >>> tel['guido'] = 4127
                    >>> tel
                    {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127}
                    >>> tel['jack']
                    4098
                    >>> del tel['sape']
                    >>> tel['irv'] = 4127
                    >>> tel
                    {'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127}
                    >>> list(tel)
                    ['jack', 'guido', 'irv']
                    >>> sorted(tel)
                    ['guido', 'irv', 'jack']
                    >>> 'guido' in tel
                    True
                    >>> 'jack' not in tel
                    False
                </code>
                <p>The dict() constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs:</p>
                <code>
                    >>> dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])
                    {'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}

            <section class="main-section" id="del_statement">
                <header><h2>del statement</h2></header>
                <p>There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del statement. This differs from the pop() method which returns a value. The del statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment of an empty list to the slice).</p>

                    >>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]
